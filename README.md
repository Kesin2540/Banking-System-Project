# 🏦 Banking System in C++

A console-based banking system built with C++ that allows users to manage simple banking operations. This project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming and file handling to create, access, and modify account data with persistent storage.

## 📌 Features

   - 🔐 Create a new bank account
   - 💰 Deposit and withdraw funds
   - 📊 Check account balance
   - 🧾 View all account holders
   - 🔍 Search for an account by account number
   - ✏️ Modify account details
   - ❌ Delete an account
   - 💾 Persistent data storage using file I/O

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

   - C++
   - File Handling: fstream, ifstream, ofstream
   - OOP Concepts: Classes, encapsulation, static members
   - Standard Template Library: map for managing accounts
   - Console-based UI: Menu-driven input/output system

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

   - 📂 File streams and data persistence
   - 🔄 Reading/writing structured data
   - 🧱 Object-oriented design (classes, encapsulation, static variables)
   - 🖥 Console-based user interaction (menu, input validation)
   - 📌 Basic use of STL (map) for account management
